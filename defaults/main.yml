# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not
# ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be
# defined using space (and/or comma) separator.
# 127.0.0.1/8 is included by default.

# "backend" specifies the backend used to get files modification.
# Available options are "pyinotify", "gamin", "polling", "systemd" and "auto".
# This option can be overridden in each jail as well.
#
# pyinotify: Requires pyinotify (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#               If pyinotify is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# gamin:    Requires Gamin (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#               If Gamin is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# polling:   uses a polling algorithm which does not require external libraries.
# systemd: uses systemd python library to access the systemd journal.
#              Specifying "logpath" is not valid for this backend.
#              See "journalmatch" in the jails associated filter config
# auto:     Will try to use the following backends, in order:
#              pyinotify, gamin, polling.
#
# Note: if systemd backend is chosen as the default but you enable a jail
#       for which logs are present only in its own log files, specify some other
#       backend for that jail (e.g. polling) and provide empty value for
#       journalmatch.
#       See https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/issues/959#issuecomment-74901200

# "usedns" specifies if jails should trust hostnames in logs,
#   warn when DNS lookups are performed, or ignore all hostnames in logs
#
# yes:    If a hostname is encountered, a DNS lookup will be performed.
# warn:  If a hostname is encountered, a DNS lookup will be performed,
#           but it will be logged as a warning.
# no:     If a hostname is encountered, will not be used for banning,
#          but it will be logged as info.
# raw:   Use raw value (no hostname), allow use it for no-host filters/actions (example user)
fail2ban_usedns: warn

# "logencoding" specifies the encoding of the log files handled by the jail
#   This is used to decode the lines from the log file.
#   Typical examples:  "ascii", "utf-8"
#
#   auto:   will use the system locale setting
fail2ban_global_logencoding: auto
